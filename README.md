Linktree Story

In 2016 brothers Alex and Anthony Zaccaria and their business partner Nick Humphreys found a common pain point when running their digital agency, Bolster, managing social media accounts for their clients. Endlessly updating singular bio links felt like a waste of time, or worse, often got overlooked. Overnight, the first iteration of Linktree was live, and they havenâ€™t looked back since!

in 2022, with over 23 million users worldwide, Linktree is helping brands, artists, publishers, agencies and influencers better control their presence online. As the internet became more fragmented,Linktree grew functionality to better serve those using it and to streamline the content-sharing process.

They are a passionate team of developers, designers, marketers and biz ops, committed to equipping content-creators with the best tools for getting their work seen. The headquarters are in Melbourne, Australia and some offices in Sydney and Los Angeles.
